This is an Arduino library for the DHT series of low cost temperature/humidity sensors. 

Check that the DHT folder contains DHT.cpp and DHT.h. Place the DHT library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. 
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
